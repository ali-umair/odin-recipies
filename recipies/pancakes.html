    <p>Tall and fluffy. These pancakes are just right. Topped with strawberries and whipped cream,

    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine milk with vinegar in a medium bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to "sour".
        </li>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. 
            Whisk egg and butter into "soured" milk. Pour the flour mixture into the wet ingredients 
            and whisk until lumps are gone.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of 
            batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, 
            and cook until browned on the other side.
